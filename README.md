## Proposal for assignmentD video

<b>Title</b>: Heart Beat

<b>Short abstract/description</b>:

<i>"Heart Beat"</i> shall be a refinement of my previous sketch in assignmentB with an object sketch that I had done for practice. My soundtrack used is titled <i>"Heart Beat"</i>. The sketch will be organic in nature.

The purpose of the video should serve as a reminder how vast our life boundaries are; life is always full of ups and down. The piece should give strength and encouragement to everyone to continue to breathe for the one they love, as it is the most genuine reason to strive for in life.

<b>Selected references are relevant to my work:</b>

Mikkel Koser's <i>COP15 Identity</i> shows how he manipulates the ControlP5 which allows the sketch to be controlled using a controller/keyboard for <u>live performance</u> to evolve the <u>algorithmic lines</u> from simplexity to complexity. The visuals are also <u>audio interactive</u> which changes according to the <u>mood/tension</u> of the music piece.

Reinoud van Laar's <i>Fluid Leaves/Leaves Pattern</i> made use of libraries such as ControlP5 and Geomerative. What I enjoy particularly is the </u>random replica of</u> </u>algorithmic patterns</u> which also incorporate <u>PerlinNoise</u>. He manipulates the initial simple organic waveforms and transform it into different random algorithm forms and elements (noise waveforms).


The above references inspire me to work in this direction visually.
