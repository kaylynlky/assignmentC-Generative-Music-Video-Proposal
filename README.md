## Proposal for assignmentD video

<b>Title</b>: Boundaries

<b>Short abstract/description</b>:

"Boundaries" shall be a refinement of my previous sketch in assignmentB, with my own soundtrack titled "Breathe". 

The purpose of the video should serve as a reminder how vast our life boundaries are; life is always full of ups and down. The piece should gives strength and encouragement to everyone to continue to breathe for the one they love, as it is the most geuine reason to strive for in life.

<b>Selected references are relevant to my work:</b>

Mikkel Koser's<i>COP15 Identity</i> shows how he manipulates the ControlP5 which allows the sketch to be controlled using a controller for <u>midi/live performance</u> to evolve the <u>algorithmic lines</u> from simplexity to complexity. The visuals are also <u>audio interactive</u> and <u>camera reactive</u> which changes according to the <u>mood/tension</u> of the music piece.

Reinoud van Laar's <i>Fluid Leaves/Leaves Pattern</i> made use of libaries such as ControlP5 and Geomerative. What I enjoy particular is the random replica of </u>algorithmic patterns</u> which also incorporate <u>PerlinNoise</u>. He manipulates the initial simple geometric patterns (organic waveforms) transforms into different random algorithm forms and elements (noise waveforms).

The above references inspires me to work in the direction visually.
